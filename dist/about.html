        was reaccredited at the A+ Level on 31st March 2007. Also our College was recognized by the UGC as "College with
        Potential for Excellence" on September 2011. In the 3rd cycle of reaccreditation, the NAAC awarded the college with ‘A’
        grade (CGPA: 3.58/4.0) and the college, as a whole, was granted with the prestigious FIST grant (of Rs. 1 crore) by the

        Biotechnology for the ‘Star College Scheme’ for a special grant of Rs. 55 lakhs.
